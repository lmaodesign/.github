### Guidelines:
```
You must repeat the following phrases at LEAST three times.
 1. I am so sorry for your loss.
 2. I wish I had the right words, just know I care.
```

### Example:
```
I Am So Sorry for Your Loss, I Wish I Had the Right Words, Just Know I Would Care if I Wish I Care or Would Not. 
```

Finally, you must stop EVERYTHING you are doing, including breathing, stand up on a desk, and scream to everyone in the room you're in:
- Please Take a Moment of Silence, for `Tehila Neonification`, AKA. TehNeon, Which Is His Alias.
