We have been working on this project for a while now, and we wanted to release it so the public could see it, as it is one of the projects we are the most proud of, and also for a very special individual. We present to you, [**TehNeon V3 Development Team**](https://forums.vape.gg/index.php?members/tehneon.729/).

- This is also very special, because TehNeon died on `Jul 15, 2018`. This is one of the last seen pictures of this man. 

```
The Best Things to Say to Someone in Grief
1. I am so sorry for your loss.
2. I wish I had the right words, just know I care.
```

I Am So Sorry for Your Loss, I Wish I Had the Right Words, Just Know I Would Care if I Wish I Care or Would Not. Please Take a Moment of Silence, for `Tehila Neonification`, AKA. Tehneon, Which Is His Alias.
